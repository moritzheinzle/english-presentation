					<h2>Technical Background of GPT</h2>
					<p>Understanding the architecture and training behind GPT models (like GPT-3 and GPT-4).</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide 2: GPT Architecture (Transformer-Based) -->
				<section>
					<h2>GPT Architecture</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Transformer Architecture:</strong> GPT is based on the Transformer model, which uses self-attention layers to process input text in parallel rather than sequentially.</li>
						<li><strong>Decoder-Only Model:</strong> GPT uses only the decoder part of the Transformer architecture (unlike BERT, which uses both the encoder and decoder). This makes it particularly suited for text generation tasks.</li>
						<li><strong>Self-Attention Mechanism:</strong> In each layer, GPT uses self-attention to learn the relationships between all words in a sequence, regardless of their position in the text.</li>
						<li><strong>Positional Encoding:</strong> Since GPT processes text in parallel (and not sequentially), it incorporates positional encodings to maintain word order information.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide 3: Training and Fine-Tuning -->
				<section>
					<h2>Training and Fine-Tuning</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Pretraining:</strong> GPT models are pretrained on large corpora of text data using the objective of predicting the next word in a sequence (causal language modeling).</li>
						<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> GPT learns patterns, context, and language structure by predicting the next token using unsupervised learning methods.</li>
						<li><strong>Fine-Tuning:</strong> After pretraining, GPT can be fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization) using supervised learning on labeled datasets.</li>
						<li><strong>Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning:</strong> GPT-3 is particularly strong in zero-shot and few-shot learning. It can perform tasks without explicit retraining by interpreting examples provided in the prompt.</li>

						<h2>Ethics of AI</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong>
								<p>AI systems are trained on data, and if the data is biased, the AI can unintentionally make biased decisions. It's crucial to develop fair AI that treats everyone equally, irrespective of race, gender, or background.</p>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong>
								<p>As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, safeguarding personal data becomes even more critical. AI systems must be designed with privacy in mind to protect sensitive information and ensure security in an increasingly digital world.</p>
							</li>

						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong>
								<p>AI systems often operate as "black boxes," making decisions without clear explanations. Ensuring transparency in AI decision-making processes and holding AI developers accountable for their systems is essential for trust and societal acceptance.</p>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong>
								<p>As AI automates more tasks, there’s concern about job displacement. It's vital to explore how AI can complement human workers rather than replace them, and invest in reskilling workers for new opportunities in an AI-driven world.</p>
							</li>
							<li><strong>AI for Good:</strong>
								<p>AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for social good, but we need to ensure it's developed responsibly and for the benefit of all.</p>

					<h2>Evolution of AI Research</h2>
					<p>The field of AI research has evolved over several decades. It began in the 1950s, with researchers aiming to mimic human reasoning in machines. Early AI research was inspired by symbolic approaches, logic, and rule-based systems. Over time, research has shifted to statistical approaches and machine learning techniques, leading to the creation of more adaptable, flexible, and scalable systems. Today, AI research is multidisciplinary, bringing together computer scientists, ethicists, linguists, and others to advance the field.</p>
