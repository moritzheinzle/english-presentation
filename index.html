					<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
					<p>
						Deep learning is an advanced type of ML that learns to identify complex patterns in text, images, and sounds.

						With deep learning, data is processed and classified through layers, and each layer has a role to play in the processing of input data.

						Here’s a quick look at the different types of layers in a deep learning neural network:

					<ul>
						<li><strong>input layer: </strong> receives raw data and passes it through</li>
						<li><strong>hidden layer: </strong> assess and process the input data and transform it into an output.</li>
						<li><strong>outer layer: </strong> uses the processed data to deliver a result.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Examples:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): </strong>re for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs are powerful for tasks like image classification, object detection, and even playing games.</li>
						<li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): </strong> re suited for sequential data like time series or natural language. RNNs are for applications like language modeling and machine translation.</li>
						<li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs): </strong>are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. This makes them effective for tasks involving sequential data that spans over long sequences.</li>
